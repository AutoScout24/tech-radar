Game day exercises,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"We want to avoid the ""backup without recovery"" or the ""untested disaster readiness plan"". We should excercise our disaster recovery strategy regularly and have game days with different kinds of disasters. It is expected that game day excercises lead to many challenges and expose missing automation and concepts. <a href=""http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2016/3/3/the-new-normal-minimize-risk-by-maximizing-change"">The new normal: Minimize risk by maximizing change</a>"
External user journey monitoring,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"In addition to monitoring individual services, we need to make sure that typical journeys of our users on AutoScout24 are working and performant from the outside. For example, the search funnel journey from home page to creating a lead or the journey to create a listing."
Performance monitoring,adopt,techniques,FALSE,Continuous monitoring and visualizing most important client side performance metrics on team dashboards. The goal is that degradation in client side performance is treated in the same way as red builds or bugs in production.
Business KPI monitoring,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"In addition to a ""keep the lights on"" monitoring, we need to include a business minded approach to monitoring. Include relevant business KPIs on dashboards and alert on anomalies in those metrics. Is everything green for our customers and our business?  "
Architecture decision records,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"<a href=""https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools"">Architecture decision records</a> are a lightweight approach to document important architecural decisions. The records of those decisions live in the same repository as the service itself."
Canary releases,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"The name for this technique originates from miners who would carry a canary in a cage down the coal mines. If toxic gases leaked into the mine, it would kill the canary before killing the miners. A canary release provides a similar form of early warning for potential problems before impacting your entire production infrastructure or user base. Compared to ""Feature toggles"" or ""Blue / green deployments"" this is not a simple switch, but more a slider. Toguru as well as AutoCanary24 support canary Releases. You can canary release toggled features with traffic distribution or you can canary deploy new service instances with traffic distribution or shadow traffic. <a href=""https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/03/how-release-canaries-can-save-your-bacon-CRE-life-lessons.html"">Google blog post on canaries.</a>"
Data-driven decisions,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"Although we are experimenting and collecting data, we understand that we need to get even better at enabling experimentation across services and improve our skills at hypothesis-driven development."
Trunk-based development,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"A model of using source-control, where developers collaborate on code in a single branch called ""trunk"" or ""master"" instead of creating long-lived feature branches. They therefore avoid merge hell, do not break the build, and live happily ever after.

Opposite, feature branches isolate your work and defer continuous integration. The longer they exist the more it hurts to merge them back. Practices like Gitflow can support such a behaviour. When the only reason to start a new branch is the fear of continuous integration and therefore continuous deployment, don't do it.

Short-lived branches are ok, as long as they are merged within a day. <a href=""https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/"">More on trunk-based development.</a>"
Linting,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"Linting is the process of running a program that will analyse code for potential errors. It plays a big role for loosly typed languages. Some tools just format the code and, therefore, free the programmer from trivial work, enforce consistent styling and make code reviews simpler since only actual changes are included, other can fix simple errors. Most of the tools can be integrated in IDE of your choice as well as included in build pipeline to provide feedback during build process. We use:
* <a href=""https://eslint.org/"" target=""_blank"">ESlint</a> for JavaScript
* <a href=""http://scalameta.org/scalafmt/"" target=""_blank"">Scalafmt</a> for Scala
* <a href=""https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint"" target=""_blank"">SwiftLint</a> for Swift
* <a href=""http://tools.android.com/tips/lint"" target=""_blank"">Lint</a> for Android"
Flux pattern,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"Flux is an application architecture introduced by Facebook. Usually mentioned in conjunction with React.js, Flux is based on a one-way flow of data up through the rendering pipeline. Flux embraces the modern web landscape of client-side JavaScript applications in a way that avoids the venerable MV* clichés. This architectural style meshes well with service orientation and solves some of the problems inherent in two-way data binding."
Consumer-driven contracts (CDC),trial,techniques,FALSE,"<a href=""http://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html"">Consumer-driven contracts</a> is a pattern for evolving services. Each consumer provides a contract to the service provider. The service provider can use these contracts to check if a planned change will break a client."
Progressive web apps,trial,techniques,FALSE,"<a href=""https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/"">Progressive web apps</a> are web apps that are aiming to provide a similar experience as native apps. Depending on the device and browser our web app should progressively enhance the experience for the user."
Content Security Policy,trial,techniques,FALSE,"<a href=""https://content-security-policy.com/"">Content Security Policy (CSP)</a> is a new HTTP response header, allowing to reduce XSS risks on modern browsers by declaring what dynamic resources are allowed to load via a HTTP Header."
Container / image security scanning,trial,techniques,FALSE,"With microservices as an architectural pattern and Infinity as a platform, number of deployed Docker containers is rises tremendously. To ensure security in this environment we need to leverage automated ways of scanning for vulnerability in the Docker images as well as in the running containers."
Automated Architecture Diagram,trial,techniques,TRUE,"Documenting systems is hard. Manually created architecture diagrams are short-lived and seldomly updated. To increase the quality and currentness of our documentation we are looking into ways to automatically depict architecture diagrams. <a href=""http://gcdt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/20_kumo.html"">kumo</a> from the glomex-cloud-deployment-tools (gcdt) is an exmaple of a CloudFormation template visualization. We also want to try AWS X-Ray to generate a service graph."
Functional Programming Adoption,trial,techniques,TRUE,"Functional programming techniques such as functional composition, monadic transformations, currying and partial application can be used to handle data transformations and side-effects in a cleaner way on everyday code. Use of libraries such as <a href=""https://typelevel.org/cats/"" target=""_blank"">Cats</a> is encouraged to make functional programming accessible and easy to use and reap the full benefits of the Scala language, which is uniquely suited to bridge the OOP and functional worlds, instead of being simply ""a better Java""."
API as a product,trial,techniques,TRUE,"APIs as a way to expose business capabilities to both external and internal developers. APIs promise the ability to experiment quickly with new business ideas by recombining core capabilities. But what differentiates an API from an ordinary enterprise integration service? One difference lies in treating APIs as a product, even when the consumer is an internal system or fellow developer. Teams that build APIs should understand the needs of their customers and make the product compelling to them. Usability testing and UX research can lead to a better design and understanding of the API usage patterns and help bring a product mindset to APIs. APIs, like products, should be actively maintained and supported, and, easy to use. They should have an owner who advocates for the customer and strives for continual improvement. In our experience, product orientation is the missing ingredient that makes the difference between ordinary enterprise integration and an agile business built on a platform of APIs."
Bluepill,assess,tools,FALSE,"<a href=""https://github.com/linkedin/bluepill"">Bluepill</a> is a reliable iOS testing tool that runs UI tests using multiple simulators on a single machine."
Log everything,hold,techniques,FALSE,"Logging just everything that could be possibly be logged is wasteful, expensive and rarely useful. For example logging each and every request in Jigsaw and all ELBs on the way is causing issues with the logging infrastructure regularly. It makes operation painful, events are lost and queries are really slow. If you just need metrics like latencies, response status codes then use metrics (CloudWatch or DataDog) and not logging."
IP restrictions,hold,techniques,FALSE,"We often see IP restriction as a mechnism to prevent unauthorized access, but it sounds like a good idea only in the first place, as there is no real authentication and authorization. It also introduces a wrong dependency between our local office IT and production services in the cloud. Instead, Auth0, which became de-facto standard for internal authentication & authorization, should be used. Nevertheless for systems without immediate production impact, it can be a valid option as an additional security layer."
Custom basic authentication,hold,techniques,FALSE,"While we are in our migration phase from the datacenter to the cloud, not all platform services are available yet. Securing our APIs and administrative pages is hard without being able to use a proper OAuth2 service, therefore we have started to create workarounds by seting up custom basic authentication. Now, when Identity service supports OAuth2, we should strive to replace those solutions with proper OAuth2 implementations."
Dependencies to the data center,hold,techniques,FALSE,"While we are migrating to AWS, we have to care a lot about integrating existing services in the data center with new ones in the cloud. On the other hand we need to be careful to not build unwanted hard dependencies between those. Our new services on AWS should not fail due to issues in the datacenter. Therefore we need to avoid synchronous communication whenever possible, for example, we should avoid building UI services running in AWS using services running in the datacenter as backend services."
Microstrategy,adopt,tools,FALSE,"<a href=""https://www.microstrategy.com"">Microstrategy</a> is a business intelligence and analytics software. We use it as our central tool to analyse our data and to create dashboards."
Docker compose for local dev stacks,adopt,tools,FALSE,"<a href=""https://docs.docker.com/compose/"">Docker compose</a> allows ""one-click"" local app environment setups, which are essential for fast developer productivity, especially for complex projects that depend on multiple services to run (i.e Kafka or Elasticsearch related services). All AutoScout24 projects having dependencies should be launchable just by calling ""docker-compose up"" without any other system dependencies."
OpenAPI,adopt,tools,FALSE,"<a href=""https://www.openapis.org/"">OpenAPI</a> is a popular API description format for REST-like APIs. We chose it as main tool to describe our service. There is a rich set of tools available that can use an OpenAPI description for generating documentation, mock a server or doing CDCs. It's also possible to generate server and client code, but the usage of this feature is controversial."
OAuth2 for service-to-service communication,adopt,tools,FALSE,"Securing APIs with OAuth2 is a common pattern in the industry, we should use it for our services when they are communicating with each other over network."
Datadog automation,adopt,tools,FALSE,"<a href=""https://www.datadoghq.com/"">Datadog</a> is our central monitoring solution. Thanks to a custom AWS CloudFormation resource developed in-house, it's possible to integrate all Datadog functionality, such as timeboards, dashboards and alarms as code, making Datadog integration/changes no different than regular code changes. All teams are highly encouraged to convert their manually-created Datadog integrations to code inside CloudFormation templates."
Fastlane,adopt,tools,FALSE,"<a href=""https://fastlane.tools/"">fastlane</a> is the tool to automate all tedious tasks, like generating screenshots, dealing with code signing, and releasing your iOS and Android apps."
Docker-based selenium grid,adopt,tools,FALSE,Docker-based selenium grid launches a docker container per browser and terminates the container when browser session is finished. This approach addresses test isolation & infrastructure scalability problems.
Yarn,adopt,tools,TRUE,"Yarn is a package manager for your JavaScript code. Yarn allows you to use other developers’ solutions to different problems, making it easier for you to develop your software."
Jenkins 2,trial,tools,FALSE,"With the release of Jenkins 2 and the native support for pipelines followed by a successful PoC we believe that Jenkins can solve most of issues we have with GoCD. To mention some:
* A separate CI/CD tool for each team
* Immutable build agents (Docker)
* Customizable build agents (Docker)
* Support for GitHub PRs
* Pipeline as code (Jenkinsfile)
* Dynamic agent scaling (""pay per build"")
* SAML support"
Codacy,trial,tools,TRUE,"Codacy checks code style, security, duplication and complexity on every change while tracking code quality over time. It covers common security concerns, code style violations, best practices, code coverage and provides metrics for your projects reducing time spent for code reviews."
Bitrise,trial,tools,TRUE,"<a href=""https://www.bitrise.io/"">Bitrise</a> is a Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD) Platform as a Service (PaaS) with a main focus on mobile app development (iOS, Android, Xamarin, ...).

It is useful in particular for building iOS applications, which can be done only under macOS, because of Apple's license agreement limitations allowing to run macOS only on Apple's hardware, thus making it impossible for biggest cloud provider to provide such a functionality."
LocalStack,trial,tools,TRUE,"LocalStack provides an easy-to-use test/mocking framework for developing Cloud applications. It spins up a testing environment on your local machine that provides the same functionality and APIs as the real AWS cloud environment.

This helps improve the testing of our applications that are AWS first, without the need of deployment."
Jest + Chrome Puppetter for integration tests,trial,tools,TRUE,"<a href=""https://facebook.github.io/jest/en/"">Jest</a> (JavaScript testing framework) together with <a href=""https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer/"">Chrome Puppeteer</a> (Chrome headless browser) provide a modern, easy to write (async/await), and potent solution for writing integration tests involving frontends (such as React.js apps) and even combined with backends. It can even be used to do visual regression testing via Jest snapshot testing feature. We highly recommend it for newer projects, or existing projects still using older stacks such as karma + PhantomJS / resource-heavy setups involving Selenium."
Smashing,trial,tools,TRUE,"<a href=""https://github.com/Smashing/smashing"">Smashing</a>, the spiritual successor to Dashing (which is not maintained anymore), is a simple and very easy to learn Sinatra based framework that lets you build excellent dashboards. It looks especially great on TVs."
Pact,trial,tools,TRUE,Consumer-Driven Contracts are a testing approach to help service interfaces evolve with confidence without unknowingly breaking consumers. The similarly named Pact is an open-source tools which allow testing interactions between service providers and consumers in isolation against a contract. Both have grown out of projects which are building RESTful microservices and show great promise.
Datadog APM,assess,tools,FALSE,Datadog released its new APM tool. We feel the need for deeper insights into our applications and request flows. As it does not support the JVM yet we keep an eye on its future development.
Amazon Redshift Spectrum,assess,tools,FALSE,"<a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/spectrum/"">Amazon Redshift Spectrum</a> allows users to directly query large amounts of data residing in Amazon S3 without having to run prior transformations over this data. As such, it is an ideal candidate for queries on the data that resides in our datalake."
Sauce Labs,assess,tools,FALSE,"Cloud-based platform for automated testing of web and mobile applications. Access web browsers, mobile emulators and simulators, and real mobile devices."
AWS Glue,assess,tools,TRUE,"<a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/glue/"">AWS Glue</a> is a fully managed ETL service that comes with its own Data Catalog and extensible crawlers, thus providing a one-stop solution for periodic data processing tasks and the extraction of metadata."
AWS SSM for runtime configs,assess,tools,TRUE,"SSM allows to move (part of) your configuration to AWS, and it can be deployed as a separate CloudFormation stack. This allows to deploy configuration changes independently and in a much faster way, without having to deploy the stack. The changes need to be picked up by the instances in runtime, which requires some plumbing. Might be a nice to have for some services."
AWS Data Pipeline,hold,tools,TRUE,"<a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/datapipeline/"">AWS Data Pipeline</a> is a service that allows users to reliably process and move data as well as orchestrate multi-step ETL processes. However, as there are now better options for this task in the AWS ecosystem (namely AWS Glue), so we are putting this technology on hold."
CrossBrowserTesting.com,hold,tools,TRUE,Provides WebDriver connectivity to dozen of browsers and real devices. Also it offers the possibility to manually take bulk screenshots of web pages.
ECS / Infinity,adopt,platforms,FALSE,"When it comes to container orchestration it feels like a gold rush. At Scout24, we decided to use Amazon ECS as it provides a nice integration with IAM, is supported by CloudFormation and makes auto-scaling easy. Teams who don't want to manage their own cluster should look at Infinity, our managed ECS cluster."
Apache Spark for analytics,adopt,platforms,TRUE,"<a href=""http://spark.apache.org/"">Apache Spark</a> is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. It is replacing the traditional MapReduce paradigm. We use Apache Spark with Hive and SparkSQL as backend for Microstrategy and for most of our deep and explorative analyses."
Presto on Amazon EMR,adopt,platforms,FALSE,Presto is a technology that allows to run interactive SQL queries over petabytes of data. The fact that it is available on EMR means that we can easily unlock the potential of this technology for our analysts and do so in a highly scalable manner.
Node.js for microservices,trial,platforms,FALSE,"We would like to introduce Node.js and JavaScript as an official alternative to JVM and Scala for microservices. Node.js is generally more appealing for frontend oriented developers. Performance of Node.js is at least on par with JVM for web relevant tasks, especially with a lot of blocking I/O. The challenge is to integrate it into the AutoScout24 ecosystem."
Amazon Aurora,trial,platforms,TRUE,"Aurora allows you to leverage the power of a relational DB but still benefit from the “managed service” experience, plus a theoretical better performance and other potential capabilities Amazon will or already did build on top, like streaming."
.NET Core,trial,platforms,TRUE,"We are migrating to Scala / JVM, running on Linux, but our legacy code base is written in C#. Nevertheless, it became clear that we will not manage to rewrite everything written in C# in reasonable time, therefore, some services containing lots of complex business logic might stay written in C#, but migrated to .NET Core."
Apache Flink,assess,platforms,FALSE,"Flink is an event stream processing framework that has been successfully used to build the read side of event-sourced CQRS apps. With its modern take on managing state within the app, its checkpointing facilities and strong event processing primitives, it constitutes and interesting framework for building event-sourced CRQS systems."
ScalaTest,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,We choose ScalaTest as our primary Scala testing tool. It's easy to pick up and supports test styles that are familiar to most developers coming from other languages.
Python for automation,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,Python has been already the default language for automation at ImmobilienScout24 and Scout24. Therefore it makes sense to join our forces and use Python as default language for automation and scripting.
Python for machine learning,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"We use <a href=""https://www.python.org/"">Python</a> in machine learning use cases. Python provides a lot of scalable, state-of-the-art, free and open-source ressources for ML."
Kafka Streams,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"<a href=""https://www.confluent.io/product/kafka-streams/"">Kafka Streams</a> is an open-source stream processing library from Confluent. It offers the right set of abstractions for many of our use cases, without introducing operational complexity itself. It is tightly integrated with Kafka and does not require external dependencies for stateful operations."
GraphQL,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"<a href=""http://graphql.org/"">GraphQL</a> is a data query language for APIs. It originates from Facebook and allows the client to specify what should be returned as response. For the first set of APIs we decided to work with a simpler ""one size fits all"" model."
React.js & Redux,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"The combination of React's functional approach to UI components and one way data flow, together with Redux state management, make it a joy to develop clean, functional reactive applications, keeping the business logic, UI and side effects separated and scalable. We recommend it as the ideal solution for any mid-to-large frontend component."
Android architecture components,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"First real approach to provide a set of Android app architecture guidelines compiled into a library of components. Includes abstractions for reactive lifecycle handling, etc. <a href=""https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/index.html"">More info</a>."
Enzyme,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"Enzyme for React.js component testing: <a href=""http://airbnb.io/enzyme/"">Enzyme</a> is a React.js testing utility that lets you easily write tests for react components, all without the need to spin up a separate browser. A highlight is its snapshot-testing feature, which reduces the amount of boilerplate required to make sure code changes don't break the rendered output. Highly recommended for React applications."
React Native,trial,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"<a href=""https://facebook.github.io/react-native/"">React Native</a> is a ""framework"" for building full / hybrid native mobile apps using JavaScript and the React.js ecosystem. In the context of AutoScout24 ""mobile first"" approach and mobile/web team integration, it's looking very promising as an alternative to separate iOS / Android codebases, allowing teams to code independently in JavaScript within the existing native apps and having unified logic / techniques for Web / iOS / Android."
Akka Streams,trial,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"Previously, our experiences with Akka Streams were not as smooth as expected. The behaviour on failure caught several teams by surprise. Choose Akka Streams as deliberate decision acknowledging the odds."
Apache Avro and Schema Registry,assess,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"Use <a href=""https://avro.apache.org/"">Avro</a> as default serialisation for Kafka streams. The <a href=""http://docs.confluent.io/3.0.0/schema-registry/docs/"">Avro schema registry</a> takes care that everybody sticks to the schema and keeps it compatible."
Vue.js,assess,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"In the ever-changing world of front-end JavaScript frameworks, one of the emerging favorites appears to be Vue.js. Vue.js is a lightweight alternative to AngularJS and React. It is designed to be a very flexible and a less opinionated library that offers a set of tools for building interactive web interfaces around concepts such as modularity, components and reactive data flow. It has a low learning curve, which makes it interesting for less experienced developers and beginners. Note, though, that Vue.js is not a full-blown framework; it is focused on the view layer only and therefore is easy to integrate with other libraries or existing projects. This framework has also their spinof for mobile native development with Nativescript."
Clojure,assess,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"Clojure is a dynamic, functional language that runs on the JVM. Although its roots are in Lisp, one of the oldest computer languages, it also embodies many modern programming concepts, including lazy evaluation and advanced concurrency abstractions. Clojure has spawned a vibrant community of programmers who are contributing a rich set of frameworks and tools. One example of these is Midje, an innovative spin on unit testing and mocking frameworks."
C#,hold,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"We are migrating to Scala / JVM, running on Linux, but our legacy code base is written in C#. Nevertheless, it became clear that we will not manage to rewrite everything written in C# in reasonable time, therefore, some services containing lots of complex business logic might stay written in C#, but migrated to .NET Core. As long as we need to maintain existing stack and such services, there is still C# work to be done."
Akka for microservices,hold,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"<a href=""http://akka.io/"">Akka</a> is an actor-based library for handling concurrency and implementing reactive microservices through a distributed message system. In combination with Akka Persistence / Lagom it can be the basis for event sourced microservices. After our first attempts at building microservices with Akka and not indirectly via Play, we are not convinced."
Ruby for automation and scripting,hold,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"While ruby is still the common language for automation at AutoScout24, we believe we should join our forces (OneScout) and have only Python as default language for automation and scripting. This does not mean to change all existing tools and scripts, but new services should have a good reason to not use Python."
